Edit your website directly in the frontend. 

== Description ==

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEccSe--IWc]

Edit your website directly in the front-end. With the wysiwyg inline editor you can modify content just anywhere. You must try it to see how smooth it works!

Direct edit has an amazing image editor. Choose an image, and while you resize or crop it, it will be uploaded to the server automatically. One click and the image is inserted on your page.

== Installation ==

In the WordPress backend, search for the plugin 'directedit'. Once you found it, activate it and you are done.

In theory the website should look exactly the same when you are logged in and visit the front-end. The one exception is that links in text do not work. Use CTRL click to test them, they will open in  another tab. 

If you want to be sure, there is a great plugin "user-switching". After you install it, in the front-end just below the log-out link you will find a new link "switch off". Click it and you will see the website as an anonymus visitor. At the bottom of the page there will be a link "switch back to admin".
