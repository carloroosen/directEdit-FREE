## Getting Started ##

Make a .zip and upload it in the WordPress backend as a plugin. After activation of the plugin the website is editable in the frontend.

Frontend editing can be enabled/disabled for different content types in the plugin options. For each page/post this option can be overwritten.

Use the "copy to theme" button to modify options in the direct-edt folder in your theme.
